# <div align="center">Bank Customer Churn Prediction</div>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Despite the steady transformation over the decades, many banks today with a sizeable customer base hoping to gain a competitive edge.<br>
While retaining existing customers and thereby increasing their lifetime value is something everyone acknowledges as being important, there is little the banks can do about customer churn when they donâ€™t see it coming in the first place.<br><br>
This is where predicting churn at the right time becomes important, especially when clear customer feedback is absent.Early and accurate churn prediction empowers CRM and customer experience teams to be creative and proactive in their engagement with the customer.</p><br>

## Objectives:
In this project our goal is to predict the probability of a customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques.
## Dataset:
[Predicting Churn for Bank Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers)

## Implementation:

**Libraries:** `sklearn` `Matplotlib` `pandas` `seaborn` `NumPy` `Scipy` 


## Few glimpses of EDA:

### 1. Churn Distribution
![Churn](https://github.com/Pradnya1208/Bank-customers-churn-prediction/blob/main/output/churn%20distribution.PNG?raw=true)
 From the above chart, we can say that our traget variable is imbalanced.

### 2. Distribution of the Categorical Variables:
#### a. Grography distribution in customer attrition

#### b. Gender distribution in customer attrition
